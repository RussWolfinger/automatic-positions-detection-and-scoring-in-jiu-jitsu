1. Clone forked repo:  git clone --recursive https://github.com/RussWolfinger/automatic-positions-detection-and-scoring-in-jiu-jitsu    
Some files are hacked to avoid calling Valter's tracker model which he did not include and which we don't really need anyway.

2. Download mmetection model from here:  https://download.openmmlab.com/mmdetection/v3.0/deformable_detr/deformable-detr-refine-twostage_r50_16xb2-50e_coco/deformable-detr-refine-twostage_r50_16xb2-50e_coco_20221021_184714-acc8a5ff.pth
Save it in ./checkpoints/detection/   and name it deformable_detr_twostage_refine.pth

3. Download ViTPose model from here:
Save it in ./checkpoints/ and name it vitpose-h.pth

4. Use pip to install all required python packages as described in the repo description.

5. Note example video in ./inputs/craig_jones_triangle_escape.mp4

6. From the root directory of the repo, run   python ../../scripts/run_tracker.py
